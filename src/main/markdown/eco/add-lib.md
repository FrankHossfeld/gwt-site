# Update Information

We will add or update information on request. 

## Request for adding Libraries to the Eco System site

The GWT eco system is a living system. New libs will be created, other will be end of life. Also we know, that there are
much more libraries outside. If you think, one library not listed here is worth to be mentioned, open an issue
[here](https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt-site). This will trigger a process to get mentioned in the eco system content.

We will expect:

* The Issue must be created by a contributor of the library
* The Library must be under active development
* The Library must be well documented
* The Library must be deployed to Maven central
* The Library must be an Open Source project
* The Library requires a Apache 2 Licence

## Request for updating Library-Information

To update information of an already added library, open an issue [here](https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt-site) 
containing the desired changes.

Changes can only be requested from contributor of the library.
